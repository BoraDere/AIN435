    "* You can add as many cells as you want in-between each question, define any function and variable as needed. However, your code needs to be well-commented.  \n",
    "* Please add Markdown cells to answer the (non-coding) questions in the homework text.\n",
    "* Please be careful about the order of runs of cells. Doing the homework, it is likely that you will be running the cells in different orders, however, they will be evaluated in the order they appear. Hence, please try running the cells in this order before submission to make sure they work.    \n",
    "* Please refer to the homework text for any implementation detail. Though you are somewhat expected to abide by the comments in the below cells, they are mainly just provided for guidance and by no means are they complete and/or descriptive enough. Accordingly, as long as you are not completely off this structure and your work pattern is understandable and traceable, it is fine. For instance, you do not have to implement a particular function within a cell just because the comment directs you to do so. \n",
    "* **Required packages and functions:** numpy, skimage, matplotlib, and cv2 (OpenCV, to read and write HDR files), and you should use the functions provided in the ./ src/cp_assng2.py file of the assignment ZIP archive.\n",
    "* Working with the provided and captured exposure stacks, you will notice that your algorithms will be using a lot of memory. That's why you should be careful about how many of these images you create in your Python code, as otherwise you run the risk of filling up your memory. Further, you need to make sure you use vectorized code that processes all of its pixels in parallel, as trying to process all 25 million pixels one-by-one with a double for loop will take ages.\n",
    "* To be able to display HDR images, multiply your image with an appropriate scaling factor of your own (smaller than 1 if the image is very bright, larger than 1 otherwise), apply gamma encoding, and then use the clip and imshow functions as in Programming Assignment 1. You will likely need to experiment with a few different values for the scaling factor you apply, until you find the one that correctly exposes your image. Otherwise, it may appear very bright or very dark.\n",
    "* There will be a lot of reusing the same functionality, hence implementing the algorithms you are asked with functions (and making appropriate calls when necessary, rather than just code blocks ) is likely to be beneficial.\n",
    "* You can use the function readHDR in the code we provide to open\n",
    "and load the .HDR in Python, as otherwise to open HDR images, you'll need a dedicated viewer.\n",
    "* **This document is also your report. Show your work. Please articulate your arguments well and support them using relevant figures and images.**\n",

In general it is advisable to use downscaled images during the debugging process of your code to speed up the development process. After ensuring the correctness of the code, the final results can be obtained by running it on the full-resolution image.**\n"
